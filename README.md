# Project-Landing-Page

I'll be developing a whole web page using a design supplied to me by the Odin Project for this task.

TOP provided two images: one of the entire website <img src=".images/01.png"> and one with information on some of the fonts and colors they have utilized <img src=".images/02.png">.

I'll need to get this project as close to the concept as possible without worrying about having it pixel-perfect. The goal of this project is to design something from scratch and place the individual pieces in roughly the correct order relative to the rest.

Now, I have the option of inserting my own material into this design. According to TOP, the photos feature some pointless fake material, but if I want to build up a business and customize this website, I am welcome to do so and I'm free to experiment with the colors and fonts.
